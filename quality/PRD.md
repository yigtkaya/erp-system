# Quality Module - Product Requirements Document

## Overview

The Quality module provides comprehensive tools for managing quality control processes throughout the manufacturing and supply chain. It supports inspection planning, execution, documentation, non-conformance handling, and quality system maintenance.

## Features

### Quality Standards

- **Standard Definition**: Define and maintain quality standards applicable to various products
- **Versioning**: Track different versions of standards and their applicability

### Inspection Templates

- **Reusable Templates**: Create standardized inspection procedures for different products and processes
- **Template Types**: Support for incoming, in-process, final, and random inspection types
- **Parameter Definition**: Specify inspection parameters with acceptance criteria
- **Multi-Version Support**: Maintain multiple versions of inspection templates

### Inspection Parameters

- **Parameter Types**: Support for numeric, text, boolean, and choice-based parameters
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Define nominal values, tolerances, and acceptable ranges
- **Critical Parameters**: Identify critical-to-quality parameters
- **Measurement Units**: Associate units of measure with parameters

### Quality Inspections

- **Inspection Workflow**: Complete process from inspection planning to results recording
- **Multiple Inspection Types**: Support for incoming materials, in-process, and final product inspections
- **Result Tracking**: Record pass/fail results with quantities
- **Documentation**: Associate supporting documentation and images with inspections
- **Sampling**: Define and track sample sizes and methodologies

### Non-Conformance Management

- **Non-Conformance Tracking**: Document and track quality issues
- **Severity Classification**: Categorize issues by severity (Critical, Major, Minor)
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Document root causes of quality issues
- **Corrective and Preventive Actions**: Track actions to address and prevent recurrence
- **Resolution Flow**: Follow non-conformances from open to closed status

### Quality Documentation

- **Document Control**: Manage quality-related documents with versioning
- **Document Types**: Support for procedures, work instructions, specifications, forms, and manuals
- **Approval Process**: Track document approval and effective dates
- **Regular Review**: Schedule and track document review dates

## Technical Requirements

### Models

- `QualityStandard`: Quality standards definition
- `InspectionTemplate`: Templates for standardized inspections
- `InspectionParameter`: Parameters to inspect with acceptance criteria
- `QualityInspection`: Record of inspections performed
- `InspectionResult`: Results for individual inspection parameters
- `NonConformance`: Documentation of quality issues
- `QualityDocument`: Quality system documentation

### Business Logic

- Validation of inspection results against defined parameters
- Automatic calculation of pass/fail quantities
- Integration with other modules for seamless quality checks
- Document version control and effective date management

### Integration Points

- Core module for user information (inspectors, approvers)
- Inventory module for product information
- Manufacturing module for work orders and production outputs
- Purchasing module for goods receipts and incoming inspection
- Document storage system for quality documentation and evidence

## Security Considerations

- Role-based permissions for inspection creation and approval
- Audit trail for all quality-related activities
- Controlled access to quality documentation
- Non-repudiation of inspection sign-offs and approvals

## Future Enhancements

- Statistical process control (SPC) capabilities
- Advanced quality metrics and dashboards
- Mobile inspection capability for shop floor use
- Barcode/QR code integration for traceability
- Automated alerts for quality issues
- Integration with testing equipment for automated data capture
- Supplier quality management functionality
