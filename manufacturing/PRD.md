# Manufacturing Module - Product Requirements Document

## Overview

The Manufacturing module manages all aspects of the production process, from work order creation to finished goods output. It provides tools for production planning, material allocation, operation tracking, and resource management.

## Features

### Production Management

- **Work Orders**: Create and track production orders for manufactured products
- **Work Order Status Tracking**: Follow orders through their lifecycle (Draft, Planned, Released, In Progress, Completed, Cancelled, On Hold)
- **Priority Management**: Assign and track priorities (Low, Medium, High, Urgent) for work orders
- **Quantity Tracking**: Monitor ordered, completed, and scrapped quantities

### Production Resources

- **Production Lines**: Define and manage production lines with capacity information
- **Work Centers**: Configure work centers within production lines, including capacity and setup time
- **Resource Allocation**: Assign work to specific work centers

### Operations Management

- **Work Order Operations**: Break down work orders into sequential operations
- **Operation Scheduling**: Plan start and end dates for each operation
- **Time Tracking**: Record setup time and run time for operations
- **Operator Assignment**: Assign specific users to operations

### Material Management

- **Material Allocation**: Allocate required materials to work orders based on BOM
- **Material Consumption**: Track material usage during production
- **Allocation Status**: Monitor allocation percentages and statuses

### Production Output

- **Output Recording**: Document good and scrapped output quantities
- **Batch Tracking**: Associate outputs with batch numbers for traceability
- **Operator Tracking**: Record which operators produced output

### Production Monitoring

- **Downtime Tracking**: Record and categorize machine downtimes
- **Downtime Analysis**: Track downtime duration and reasons
- **Completion Tracking**: Monitor work order and operation completion percentages
- **Overdue Detection**: Identify late work orders

## Technical Requirements

### Models

- `ProductionLine`: Production line definitions with capacity
- `WorkCenter`: Work center definitions with capacity and setup time
- `WorkOrder`: Core production order information
- `WorkOrderOperation`: Individual operations within work orders
- `MaterialAllocation`: Materials required for work orders
- `ProductionOutput`: Production output records
- `MachineDowntime`: Downtime tracking for work centers

### Business Logic

- Automatic calculation of completion percentages
- Material allocation based on BOM structures
- Production scheduling based on capacities and priorities
- Validation rules for quantities, dates, and resource allocation

### Integration Points

- Core module for user (operator) information
- Inventory module for product information and BOM data
- Sales module for customer order fulfillment
- Quality module for inspection of production outputs

## Security Considerations

- Role-based permissions for work order creation and modification
- Audit trail for production activities
- Controlled access to production planning functions

## Future Enhancements

- Advanced production scheduling with optimization algorithms
- Machine integration for automated data collection
- Predictive maintenance based on downtime patterns
- Advanced production analytics and dashboards
- Labor tracking and efficiency calculations
- Production cost analysis
