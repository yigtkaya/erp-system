# Maintenance Module - Product Requirements Document

## Overview

The Maintenance module manages equipment maintenance activities across the organization, providing tools for preventive maintenance planning, work order management, spare parts tracking, and maintenance history. It supports both scheduled maintenance and emergency repairs.

## Features

### Equipment Management

- **Equipment Registry**: Comprehensive inventory of all equipment and machines
- **Equipment Details**: Track manufacturer, model, serial numbers, and specifications
- **Warranty Tracking**: Monitor purchase dates and warranty expiration
- **Work Center Association**: Link equipment to specific work centers

### Maintenance Planning

- **Preventive Maintenance**: Schedule recurring maintenance based on time intervals
- **Maintenance Types**: Support for preventive, corrective, predictive, and emergency maintenance
- **Scheduling**: Plan maintenance activities with frequency and estimated duration
- **Resource Planning**: Allocate time and personnel for maintenance activities

### Work Order Management

- **Work Order Generation**: Create and track maintenance work orders
- **Priority Levels**: Assign priorities (Low, Medium, High, Critical) to work orders
- **Status Tracking**: Monitor work orders through their lifecycle (Scheduled, In Progress, Completed, Cancelled, Overdue)
- **Assignment**: Assign maintenance tasks to specific personnel
- **Time Tracking**: Record estimated and actual maintenance hours

### Task Management

- **Task Breakdown**: Divide work orders into specific sequential tasks
- **Task Completion**: Track task completion status and timing
- **Documentation**: Record maintenance actions and observations

### Spare Parts Management

- **Parts Inventory**: Track spare parts inventory levels
- **Equipment Association**: Link spare parts to specific equipment
- **Minimum Stock Levels**: Define and monitor minimum stock requirements
- **Usage Tracking**: Record part usage in maintenance activities
- **Cost Tracking**: Monitor spare part costs and total maintenance costs

### Maintenance History

- **Maintenance Logs**: Maintain detailed history of all maintenance activities
- **Downtime Tracking**: Record equipment downtime durations
- **Failure Analysis**: Document breakdown reasons and solutions
- **Documentation**: Attach maintenance reports and related documents

## Technical Requirements

### Models

- `Equipment`: Equipment and machine registry
- `MaintenancePlan`: Preventive maintenance schedules
- `WorkOrder`: Maintenance work order details
- `MaintenanceTask`: Individual tasks within work orders
- `SparePart`: Spare parts inventory
- `MaintenancePartUsage`: Record of parts used in maintenance
- `MaintenanceLog`: Maintenance history records

### Business Logic

- Automatic scheduling of preventive maintenance
- Work order status progression tracking
- Spare parts inventory management
- Maintenance cost calculation
- Overdue maintenance detection

### Integration Points

- Manufacturing module for work center information
- Purchasing module for spare parts procurement
- Core module for user (maintenance personnel) information
- Document storage system for maintenance documentation

## Security Considerations

- Role-based permissions for maintenance planning and execution
- Audit trail for all maintenance activities
- Validation of work order completion sign-offs

## Future Enhancements

- Condition-based maintenance using IoT sensors
- Predictive maintenance algorithms
- Mobile access for maintenance personnel
- Equipment performance analytics
- Mean time between failures (MTBF) tracking
- Maintenance cost analysis and optimization
- Integration with equipment manufacturers for technical documentation
- Barcode/QR code scanning for equipment and parts identification
