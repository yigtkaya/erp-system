# ERP System - Overview

## Introduction

This Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system is designed to provide a comprehensive, integrated solution for manufacturing businesses. The system consists of multiple interconnected modules that together enable efficient management of the entire business process from customer orders to production planning, inventory management, quality control, and equipment maintenance.

## Architecture

The system follows a modular architecture built on Django, where each functional area is implemented as a separate Django application. This enables clean separation of concerns while allowing for seamless integration between modules. Core services and shared functionality are provided by the Core and Common modules.

## Key Modules

### Core Module

The foundation of the system, providing authentication, user management, and shared business logic. The Core module maintains base models like User, Department, and Customer that are referenced by other modules.

### Inventory Module

Manages products, stock levels, technical drawings, and bill of materials (BOM). It provides the product master data used throughout the system and tracks inventory levels.

### Sales Module

Handles customer interactions, quotations, orders, and pricing. It initiates the fulfillment process by creating sales orders that trigger production and purchasing activities.

### Manufacturing Module

Manages the production process through work orders, operations, and material allocations. It schedules production activities and tracks completion status.

### Purchasing Module

Supports the procurement process from requisitions to purchase orders and goods receipt. It ensures timely acquisition of required materials and services.

### Quality Module

Implements quality control processes through inspections, non-conformance handling, and quality documentation. It enforces quality standards across incoming, in-process, and finished goods.

### Maintenance Module

Tracks equipment maintenance activities, planning preventive maintenance, and managing work orders for repairs. It helps prevent downtime and ensures equipment reliability.

### Common Module

Provides shared utilities like file management and common services used across all modules. It reduces duplication and ensures consistency.

## Data Flow

1. **Order to Cash**:

   - Customer order received in Sales
   - Inventory checked for availability
   - Production scheduled if needed through Manufacturing
   - Quality inspections performed
   - Order fulfilled and shipped

2. **Procure to Pay**:

   - Purchase requisitions generated from inventory needs or production requirements
   - Purchase orders created and sent to suppliers
   - Goods received and inspected
   - Inventory updated
   - Invoices processed

3. **Plan to Produce**:
   - Production requirements determined from sales orders
   - Work orders created
   - Materials allocated from inventory
   - Production executed with quality checks
   - Finished goods added to inventory

## Security Model

The system implements a role-based access control model with four primary roles:

- Admin: Full system access
- Engineer: Access to technical and planning functions
- Operator: Limited to execution functions
- Viewer: Read-only access

Each module further refines permissions based on these roles and specific functions within the module.

## Future Roadmap

- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Mobile applications for shop floor and warehouse
- Integration with IoT devices for real-time monitoring
- Enhanced AI-driven forecasting
- Customer and supplier portals
